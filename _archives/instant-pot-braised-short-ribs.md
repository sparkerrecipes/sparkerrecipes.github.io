0. Add a little more oil and the carrots, onion, and garlic. Sprinkle with a tsp of salt and stir until soft, about 3-4 minutes
0. Add the tomato paste and cook another 2-3 minutes, stirring, until the paste begins to brown. Add the wine and stir to scrape up any bits on the bottom. Bring to a boil and cook until the wine reduces by about a third.
0. Add the broth, thyme, bay leaf, and ribs. The ribs should be partially submerged. Lock the lid and cook on Manual/High for 40 minutes.
0. Naturally release the pressure for 20 minutes, then quick release the rest. Remove the beef carefully and keep warm.
0. Strain the sauce and then return back into the pot. Saute on Normal to bring to a simmer, about 8-10 minutes. If you are adding the pearl onions or mushrooms, do so now.
0. Return the ribs, heat through, and serve.
