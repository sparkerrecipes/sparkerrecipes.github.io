### Ingredients
* 10 tomatillos, de-husked and rinsed well (buy a few extras, since it’s hard to tell if some are bad)
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled
* 2 serrano peppers (keep seeds in for more spice; remove some/all of them for a milder salsa)
* ¼ onion
* ¼ bunch cilantro (leaves and stems)
* 1 large, ripe avocado
* ½ tsp. salt
* juice of 2 limes (or perhaps ½ lime if you try it and that sucks)

### Instructions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the husks of the tomatillos and rinse under cold water, rubbing them gently with your fingers to remove the sticky coating.
2. Place the rinsed tomatillos face-down on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Add the garlic, serranos (stems removed), and the onion to the baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes or until the tomatillos have changed color from a bright green to a pale yellow-ish green. (Check on the garlic and serranos before this and remove them from the oven if they’re getting too browned.)
3. Let the roasted ingredients cool slightly, then add the garlic, serranos, and onion to the blender, along with two or three of the tomatillos. Pulse until all ingredients are well blended, then add the cilantro, half of the avocado, and the rest of the tomatillos, and blend well. Finally, blend in the second half of the avocado, along with the salt and fresh lime juice.
4. Taste and increase amounts of salt and/or lime juice if desired. (You could even blend in an extra half/whole avocado for a thicker, creamier, milder salsa.) For a thinner salsa — which could also be used as a salad dressing — blend in up to a few spoonfuls of cold water at the end. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the fridge. Serve over tacos or with chips. Best within the first few days.
