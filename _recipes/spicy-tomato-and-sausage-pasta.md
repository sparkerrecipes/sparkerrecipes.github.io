_This is my own recipe that combines what I liked from [David's Spicy Sausage Pasta](http://forkingrecipes.com/dpick/spicy-sausage-pasta) with some of [Emeril's similar recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/hot-and-sweet-italian-sausages-in-tomato-sauce-recipe.html). The end result is a thick, spicy, tomato-ey sauce. Because of the heat, a cold cucumber-and-pepper salad makes an excellent side dish for this._

Total Time: About 1 hour

### Ingredients
* 1 box penne pasta
* 3 spicy italian sausages or about .75 lbs, in small chunks
* 1 small sliced red onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by hand, with their juice
* 1 small can of tomato paste (about 2 tbsp)
* 8 oz mushrooms
* 8 oz dry white wine
* 1 Tbsp white sugar
* 1.5 tbsp fresh oregano
* 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
* 6 fresh basil leaves, chopped
* Freshly shredded Parmesan to garnish

### Directions
1. Cook sausages in a skillet over medium-high for about 5 minutes until just browned.
2. Remove sausages and all but a couple of tbsp of fat (add a little olive oil if there isn't enough)
3. Add onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Saute until soft, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the white wine and reduce by about half, about 7 minutes.
5. Add the tomatoes and their juice, oregano, sausage, red pepper flakes, and sugar. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 20-25 minutes until thick.
6. Cook pasta and drain.
7. Add pasta and basil to pot. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese.
