### Directions
1. Combine the marinade ingredients with the chicken and toss well to coat. Store in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
0. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Grease a rimmed sheet pan with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Add the quartered onion to the chicken and marinade, and toss to combine. Remove the chicken and onion from the marinade and place on the pan, spreading everything evenly across it.
0. _(this is a good time to start some rice)_
0. Put the chicken in the oven and roast until it is browned, crisp at the edges and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to rest 2 minutes, then slice into bits.
0. [optional] To make the chicken even more crisp, set a large pan over high heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, then the sliced chicken, and sauté until everything curls tight in the heat.
0. Scatter the parsley over the top and serve with tomatoes, cucumbers, pita, white sauce, hot sauce, olives, fried eggplant, feta, rice — really anything you desire.
