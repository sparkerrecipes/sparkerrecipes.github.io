_This goes very well over rice or as tacos. Either way, serve it with [cabbage slaw](/recipes/quick-cabbage-slaw)._

### Ingredients
* 3 lb boneless pork shoulder blade roast, trimmed
* 4-5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 tbsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp Mexican oregano
* 1/2 tbsp cumin
* 1/4 tsp fresh black pepper
* 3 oranges
* 2 limes

### Directions
1. Cut slits into the pork and stuff with half the garlic.
2. Combine remaining ingredients, pour over pork.
3. Place in the ceramic slow cooker dish, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Turn at least one so the marinate covers all the pork.
4. Cook the pot on low, 8 hours.
5. Remove the pork, shred, and return the pork to the pot with about 1c of the liquid.
6. Adjust the salt, pepper, and cumin, then cook for another 15-30 minutes
