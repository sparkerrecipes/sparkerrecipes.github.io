_Perhaps my favorite cocktail. This is our best recreation of the ""It's Finally Spring"" cocktail from the restaurant SOLA here in Chicago (RIP)._

### Ingredients
* 2 oz gin, the nicest you can find.
* 1 oz St. Germain
* 3/4 oz lime juice
* 1/2 oz "lemongrass simple syrup" (you can find [a good lemongrass simple syrup recipe at Girl Cooks World](http://www.girlcooksworld.com/2013/10/ginger-and-lemongrass-syrup.html)).

### Directions
1. Combine ingredients by shaking. Serve with no ice.
