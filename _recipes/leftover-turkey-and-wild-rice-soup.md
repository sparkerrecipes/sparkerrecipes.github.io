### Ingredients
* 1 medium onion chopped
* 2 medium carrots peeled & chopped
* 3 sticks celery chopped
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning or more to taste
* 3 heaping tablespoons flour
* 6 cups chicken broth
* 1 cup uncooked wild rice
* 2 cups (or more) cooked turkey meat shredded/cut up
* 7 ounces cremini mushrooms sliced
* Salt & pepper to taste
* 1/2 cup heavy/whipping cream optional

### Directions
* Prep your onion, carrots, and celery. I just roughly chopped the carrots and celery.
* Add the oil and butter to a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Stir in the garlic, Italian seasoning, and flour. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
* Whisk in the chicken broth until the flour is dissolved.
* Stir in the rice.
* Increase the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil. Once it's just boiling, cover the pot with the lid slightly ajar. Reduce the heat so it's gently boiling for 15 minutes.
* If you haven't already prepped the turkey and mushrooms, you can do it now.
* Add the turkey and mushrooms to the soup. Increase the heat again so it just comes to a boil, then reduce the heat so it's simmering again and continue cooking the soup for another 15-20 minutes (cover with lid slightly ajar) or until the rice is tender (wild rice does have a bit of "chew" to it, though).
* Stir in the cream (if using). Season soup with salt & pepper as needed.
