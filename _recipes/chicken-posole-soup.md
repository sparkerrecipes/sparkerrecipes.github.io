*This comes out a little more green than I think a traditional Pozole Soup should, but I have a thing for tomatillos. It will make a believer out of you.*

### Ingredients
* 5c chicken stock (1 qt & 1 cup)
* 1c water
* 1 rotisserie chicken
* 1/2 pound tomatillos, halved (about 3-4)
* 1/2 small onion in chunks
* 1 poblano chile in chunks
* 1 jalapeño in chunks, about half of seeds removed
* 2 large garlic cloves
* 1/4c chopped cilantro
* 1/2 tbsp oregano

### Directions
1. In a large stockpot, boil the chicken stock and water, then reduce to a simmer.
2. In a blender, combine the tomatillos, onion, poblano, jalapeño, garlic, cilantro, and oregano.
3. Pulse until coarsely chopped, scraping down the side.
4. Add 1/2c of the chicken stock, puree until smooth. Season the tomatillo puree with salt and pepper.
5. In a large, deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil until shimmering. Add the tomatillo puree and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce turns a deep green, about 12 minutes.
6. While this is cooking, remove the skin from the chicken and separate into chunks by hand.
6. Pour the tomatillo sauce into the chicken stock. Add the hominy and chicken, bring to a simmer until just heated.
