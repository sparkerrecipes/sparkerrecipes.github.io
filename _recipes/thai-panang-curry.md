* 1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch or arrowroot starch

### Curry Ingredients
* 2c cooked brown rice
* 1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil
* 1 small white or yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
* Pinch of salt, more to taste
* 1 red bell pepper, sliced into thin (¼” wide) strips
* 1 yellow, orange or green bell pepper, sliced into thin (¼” wide) strips
* 3 carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal into ¼” thick rounds (about 1 cup)
* 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
* 1 to 2 tablespoons panang curry paste* (use 1 for mild or 2 for spicy)
* 1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk
* ½ cup water
* 2 tablespoons peanut butter
* 1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce**
* 1 ½ teaspoons coconut sugar or brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons fresh lime juice, to taste
* Optional garnishes: fresh Thai basil or regular basil, sriracha or chili garlic sauce for extra spice

### Tofu Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the tofu from sticking.
0. Gently squeeze the tofu to release some of the water. Slice the tofu into thirds lengthwise so you have 3 even slabs. Stack the slabs on top of each other and slice through them lengthwise to make 3 even columns, then slice across to make 5 even rows (see photos).
0. Line a cutting board with a lint-free tea towel or paper towels, then arrange the tofu in an even layer on the towel(s). Fold the towel(s) over the cubed tofu, then place something heavy on top (like another cutting board, topped with a cast iron pan or large cans of tomatoes) to help the tofu drain. Let the tofu rest for at least 10 minutes (preferably more like 30 minutes, if you have the time).
0. Transfer the pressed tofu to a medium mixing bowl and drizzle with the olive oil and tamari. Toss to combine. Sprinkle the starch over the tofu, and toss the tofu until the starch is evenly coated, so there are no powdery spots remaining.
0. Arrange the tofu in an even layer. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing the tofu halfway, until the tofu is deeply golden on the edges. Use as desired.

### Curry Directions
0. Heat a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.
0. Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are easily pierced through by a fork, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and curry paste and cook, while stirring, for 1 minute.
0. Add the coconut milk and water, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers and carrots have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you’re adding crispy tofu, stir it in now.
0. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the peanut butter, tamari, sugar and lime juice. Add salt, to taste (I usually add a pinch or two). If the curry needs a little more punch, add ½ teaspoon more tamari, or for more acidity, add ½ teaspoon more lime juice.
0. Divide rice and curry into bowls and garnish with fresh basil, if using. If you love spicy curries, serve with sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.
