### Ingredients
* 2 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut or pounded into thin pieces
* 2–3 tablespoons thai seasoning from the fridge (buy a replacement, scott)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons avocado oil (divided)
* 2 shallots, thinly sliced
* 4-6 cups finely shredded curly kale, stems removed (about 6-8 stalks)
* 2 tablespoon yellow curry paste (see notes for subs)
* 2 can full-fat coconut milk
* 2 tablespoon soy sauce
* 2 tablespoon brown sugar


### Directions - Crock Pot
1. Cook the Chicken: Coat the chicken with the spices. In a large nonstick pan, heat 1 tablespoon of avocado oil over medium high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Set chicken aside.
1. Start the Coconut Kale: If needed, wipe your pan out (see notes). In the same pan, add 1/2 tablespoon avocado oil if needed. Saute the shallots, kale, and yellow curry paste for 5 minutes until everything is aromatic and tender.
1. Simmer the Coconut Kale: Add all other sauce ingredients; simmer for 5-10 minutes to thicken. When the sauce has thickened, tuck the chicken back in the sauce. Let it get gently bubbly and spoon the sauce over top.
1. You’re Done! Yum! Sprinkle the whole thing with cilantro. Serve chicken with scoops of the sauce over rice! Finish with whatever toppings you like – for me it’s chili crisp!
