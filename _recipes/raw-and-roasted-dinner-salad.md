### Ingredients
* 1 large delicata squash (about 20 oz.)
* 1 15-oz. can chickpeas
* 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 3 tsp. kosher salt, divided
* 1 small head of red cabbage (about 1 lb.)
* 2 lemons
* 1 small garlic clove
* ⅓ cup tahini
* 1 Tbsp. honey
* 1 large Asian pear or sweet-tart apple, such as Pink Lady
* ½ cup pecan halves
* 4 oz. feta

### Directions
0. Place a rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 475°. Slice the squash in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, remove seeds. Cut each half again lengthwise, then crosswise into 1" pieces. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet.
0. Rinse chickpeas, pat dry with paper towels. (The drier they are, the crispier they will become, so don't skip this step!) Add to pan with squash. Add 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tsp. kosher salt to pan with squash mixture and toss to combine.
0. Roast squash and chickpeas, tossing once halfway through with a spatula, until well browned and chickpeas are crispy, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly on pan about 5 minutes.
0. Meanwhile, cut 1 small head of red cabbage into quarters and remove core. Slice quarters crosswise into ¾"-thick strips. Transfer to a large bowl.
0. Juice 2 lemons. Pour 3 Tbsp. juice over cabbage, reserving remaining juice.
0. Add 1 tsp. kosher salt and remaining 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil to bowl with cabbage and massage with your hands until cabbage is beginning to wilt. Stop when it's as crisp-tender as you like it. Let sit until ready to use.
0. Finely grate 1 small garlic clove into bowl with reserved lemon juice. Whisk in ⅓ cup tahini, 1 Tbsp. honey, 1 Tbsp. water, and remaining 1 tsp. kosher salt. The dressing should be thick but pourable, so if it needs to be thinned out, add more water by the teaspoonful.
0. Quarter and core 1 Asian pear or sweet-tart apple. Slice each quarter crosswise into ½"-thick pieces. Transfer to bowl with cabbage.
0. Add roasted veggies to bowl with cabbage and pear. Spread ½ cup pecan halves onto empty pan and toast just until fragrant, 3–4 minutes. Let cool slightly while you assemble the salad.
0. Pour dressing over cabbage mixture and toss to combine. Transfer to a large platter.
0. Thinly slice 4 oz. feta into planks and coarsely crumble over salad.
0. Using your hands, crush pecans over salad and serve.
