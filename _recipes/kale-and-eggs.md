### Ingredients
* 1 bunch of kale and 1 egg per serving
* Feta or goat cheese

### Instructions
0. Remove the ribs from the kale and cut the greens into small pieces. If they are wet from rinsing, dry them a bit.
0. Heat a bit of olive oil and butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook the greens for 3-4 minutes, stirring often but also covering (mostly just to let the cover heat up)
0. Make a small well in the greens for each egg, then crack an egg into the well, salt a bit on top, and cover & cook until just set.
0. Serve with crumbed cheese or toasted pine nuts.
