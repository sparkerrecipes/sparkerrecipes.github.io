### Ingredients
* 1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
* Kosher salt
* 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 large garlic cloves, very thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
* 3 to 4 cured oil-packed anchovy fillets, finely chopped
* 1 large lemon, zested and juiced

### Directions
0. Blanch the green beans. Set a bowl of cold water and ice near the stove. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and salt the water very well (estimate about 1 tablespoon of kosher salt per quart of boiling water). Drop the green beans into the boiling salted water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, just until bright green. Then, use tongs to transfer the green beans to the bowl of iced water and let cool (this will stop the cooking process so the beans stay crisp).
0. Make the garlic chips. In a small saucepan warm the olive oil over medium heat until just shimmering. Drop the sliced garlic in and cook for about 30 seconds or until the garlic has turned golden brown and crispy (it should not be burned). Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and set aside for now.
0. Make the dressing. In a small bowl, combine the chives, parsley, finely chopped anchovies, lemon zest and juice. Pour the olive oil slowly into the bowl while whisking continuously until the dressing has emulsified. Taste and, if needed, add a small pinch of salt and whisk again to combine.
0. Finish and serve. Drain the green beans well and transfer to a serving platter. Pour the dressing all over the beans and toss gently. Garnish with the crispy garlic and serve.
