## Ingredients
* 12 oz. farfalle
* 4 cloves garlic (either fresh or roasted), minced
* 3-4 roma tomatoes, diced
* 2/4 a red onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cup)
* 1 lb. raw, frozen shrimp
* 6 oz. baby fresh spinach
* freshly grated parmesan
* 1 tbsp. EVOO
* 2 tbsp butter

#### Vinaigrette

* 2 tbsp parsley, finely cut
* 1/3c olive oil
* 4 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 2 tbsp white wine
* 1/2 tsp salt
* Juice of 1/2 lemon, optional

## Instructions

Start the shrimp thawing while you heat a large skillet to just over medium and start cooking the pasta. 

While the pasta is cooking, mince the garlic and cut up the onion and tomatoes in pretty decent-sized chunks; a couple of D6 for the tomatoes and about 1.5 inch strips for the onions. If you are still waiting on the pasta to cook, go ahead and start on the vinaigrette below.

Heat a large skillet to just over medium and add the 1 tbsp EVOO and butter. When the butter is just bubbling, add the garlic and shelled, thawed shrimp. Saute for about 90 seconds and add the onions, tomatoes, and cooked pasta. Saute for about another 4 minutes.

Add the spinach and vinaigrette and saute for another couple of minutes until the spinach is wilted and the vinaigrette is evenly mixed.

Serve immediately and add fresh grated Parmesan to taste

### Vinaigrette

Just whisk together all the ingredients.
