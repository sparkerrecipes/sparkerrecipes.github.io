_Nothing impresses like homemade barbecue sauces. My dirty secret is that it is stunningly easy. The book CHEATER BBQ has loads of tasty homemade barbecue sauces. It seems to be out-of-print but you can still track down a copy easily enough. It's my barbecue bible._

The wonderful book CHEATER BBQ by Mindy Merrell and R.B. Quinn

### Ingredients
* 1 small onion
* 1/2 c cider vinegar
* 1/2 c ketchup
* 1/2 c brown sugar
* 2 tbsp Worcestershire
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp bottled smoke
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp coarsely ground black pepper
* 1/8-1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

### Directions
1. Heat the oil over medium-high heat as you grate the onion.
2. Cook the onion in the heated oil for about 5 minutes. You want it tender but not yet browned.
3. Stir in everything else and simmer until it thickens a little.

This should usually keep for about a week and makes enough for about 4-5 lbs of meat.
