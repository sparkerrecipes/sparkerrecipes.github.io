### Ingredients
* 1/4 cup harissa paste
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 1 tsp lemon juice + 1 tsp lemon zest
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp cumin
* 6–8 cloves garlic, grated (depends on how much you love garlic & the size of your cloves)
* 2 lbs chicken thighs, about 6-8 thighs (can be boneless or bone in)
* Optional: additional harissa, lemon slices & fresh herbs to garnish

### Directions
1. Make the harissa rub. In a large bowl combine harissa, olive oil, lemon juice & zest, salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, & garlic. Mix well.
1. Prep the oven & chicken. Preheat your oven to 400° F/205° C. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels before adding to the bowl with the harissa mix and rubbing to coat the chicken all over.
1. Roast. Cook the chicken for 40 minutes, or until cooked through (it should reach an internal temperature of 165° F / 74° C). The time this takes will vary depending on if you’re using boneless or bone in thighs.
1. Serve. Let the chicken rest for at least 5 minutes before serving with a squeeze of additional harissa, lemon juice & fresh herbs.
