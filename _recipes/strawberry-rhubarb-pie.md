_Very good with [Brown Sugar Whipped Cream](/recipes/brown-sugar-whipped-cream.html) and [Vodka Pie Crust](/recipes/pie-crust.html)_

### Ingredients
* 2 lbs fresh strawberries
* 4c fresh rhubarb
* 1c sugar (or less/more to taste), divided
* 5 tbsp tapioca starch
* egg wash (1 egg beaten with a big pinch of kosher salt)
* turbinado sugar for sprinkling (optional)

### Time

5 min prep, 45 min pre-baking, 5 min more prep, 45 baking.

100 minutes total.

### Instructions
0. Remove the tops from strawberries and quarter them. Chop rhubarb into 1/2 inch pieces.
0. Toss strawberries and rhubarb together with 1/4 cup of sugar, and allow them to macerate (the sugar will begin to break down the fruit, releasing some liquid) for 20 minutes.
0. Separately, whisk together remaining 3/4 cup sugar and tapioca starch.
0. Drain off excess liquid from the strawberry mixture using a strainer.
0. Add the sugar mixture to fruit mixture. Stir well until all of the starch has dissolved.
0. Pour filling into prepared, chilled dough shaped in a pie plate.
0. Preheat oven to 425° F. Place the chilled, rolled top crust over the filling. Trim the edges and crimp as desired. Cut slits or patterns in the top with a sharp pairing knife. Chill for 20 minutes before baking.
0. Apply egg wash to the top of the pie and, if you'd like, sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Place chilled pie into a 425° F oven. Rotate the pie every 15 minutes for a total of about 45. If top or edges are browning too quickly, place aluminum foil over effected area. Bake until the top is a deep golden brown and filling is bubbling in the center.
0. Allow pie to cool for 30 minutes before serving.
