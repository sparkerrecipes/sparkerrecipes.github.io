_Yum! This is a hearty, savory soup. I make it all the time. We took it camping, and it was the hit of our trip._

### Ingredients
* 1/2 lb of bacon
* 2 cans of cannellini beans
* 4 sticks of celery
* 1 qt chicken broth
* 1 pt of cherry tomatoes
* 1 medium onion
* green onions to taste (I like several stalks, my wife likes it toned down)
* 3 cloves garlic 

### Steps
1. Cut the bacon into small pieces and fry it up in a large saucepan until just crispy. 
2. Cut up the celery, tomatoes, onions, and garlic while the bacon is frying
3. Spoon out half the bacon
4. Add celery to the saucepan along with a bit of olive oil (1 tbsp or so)
0. Cook the celery for 5 minutes and add the rest of the veggies.
5. Cook veggies and bacon for about 7-10 min or until the veggies are pretty soft
6. Meanwhile, heat the chicken broth to a gentle boil and add the beans to cook
7. After about 10 minutes of boiling, combine everything
8. Top bowls with reserved bacon!
