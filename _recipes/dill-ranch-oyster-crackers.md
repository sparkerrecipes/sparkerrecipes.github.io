### Ingredients
* 1 bag of oyster crackers (9–10 ounces)
* 1 packet of ranch seasoning (I use the 1-ounce packet of Hidden Valley ranch)
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil, or 1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled (see notes)
* 1 teaspoon dried dill (2 teaspoons if you love dill like I do)

### Directions
0. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
0. Whisk the ranch seasoning, oil, and dried dill together. 
0. Pour mixture over the oyster crackers in a large bowl. Stir gently to combine. (Taste and adjust at this point and make them your own! Add some red pepper flakes, extra garlic or onion powder, etc.)
0. Transfer to a sheet pan; bake for 15-20 minutes until dried. Keep warm until ready to serve
