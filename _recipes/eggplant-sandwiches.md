### Ingredients
* 4 (3/4-inch-thick) eggplant slices
* 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
* 1 large red bell pepper
* 4 (1-ounce) slices ciabatta bread
* 2 tablespoons refrigerated pesto
* 1 cup baby arugula
* 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup (2 ounces) soft goat cheeser

### Directions
1. Preheat broiler.
2. Arrange eggplant slices in a single layer on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush both sides of eggplant with 1 teaspoon oil. Cut bell pepper in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membrane. Arrange bell pepper halves, skin sides up, on baking sheet with eggplant; flatten with hand.
3. Broil 4 minutes; turn eggplant over (do not turn bell pepper over). Broil an additional 4 minutes; remove eggplant from pan. Broil bell pepper an additional 7 minutes or until blackened. Place bell pepper in a zip-top plastic bag; seal. Let stand for 15 minutes; peel and discard skin.
3. Broil bread slices for 2 minutes or until lightly browned, turning once.
4. Spread 1 tablespoon pesto on each of 2 bread slices. Layer each bread slice, pesto side up, with an eggplant slice, 1 bell pepper half, and another eggplant slice.
5. Toss arugula with remaining 1 teaspoon oil and black pepper; divide arugula mixture evenly between sandwiches.
6. Spread 2 tablespoons goat cheese over each of 2 remaining bread slices; place, cheese side down, on sandwiches.
