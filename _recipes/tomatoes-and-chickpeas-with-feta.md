### Ingredients
* 2 lb. heirloom or other large tomatoes, cored, cut into 1½"-thick wedges
* Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
* 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
* Freshly ground pepper
* 2 15.5-oz. cans chickpeas, rinsed, patted dry
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* ½ tsp. smoked paprika
* 1 lb. feta, cut into ½"-thick slabs
* 1 large handful arugula
* ½ cup torn, pitted green olives
* Sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar (for drizzling)

### Directions
0. Place racks in middle and top positions of oven; preheat to 425°. Arrange 2 lb. heirloom or other large tomatoes, cored, cut into 1½"-thick wedges, on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper; toss to coat. Roast on middle rack until collapsed and slightly jammy, 25–30 minutes. Remove from oven and heat broiler.
0. Meanwhile, combine two 15.5-oz. cans chickpeas, rinsed, patted dry, 1 tsp. ground cumin, ½ tsp. smoked paprika, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton salt in a medium bowl. Drizzle lightly with oil and toss to coat.
0. Spoon chickpea mixture over and around tomatoes. Break 1 lb. feta, cut into ½"-thick slabs, into large pieces and tuck around. Broil on top rack until tomatoes and feta are blistered, 8–10 minutes. Let tomato-chickpea mixture cool 5 minutes.
0. Scatter 1 large handful arugula and ½ cup torn, pitted green olives over tomato-chickpea mixture. Drizzle some sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar and more oil over; season with pepper. Serve with pita.
