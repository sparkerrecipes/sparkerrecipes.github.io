### Instructions
0. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Place 1 lb. cherry tomatoes, halved, and 1 ear of corn, shucked, kernels removed (about 1 cup), on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil over and season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper; toss to coat. Scatter 2 large thyme sprigs over, breaking up into smaller pieces. Roast until tomato skins are wrinkled and some juices have released onto baking sheet, 30–35 minutes. Let cool; discard thyme
0. Meanwhile, heat ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add 1 small fennel bulb, fronds removed, finely chopped, 2 medium leeks, white and pale green parts only, quartered lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise , 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped; cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if needed, until softened but without taking on any color, 12–15 minutes.
0. Add 1 fresh or dried bay leaf, 8 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and remaining 3 large thyme sprigs; increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Add ¾ cup pearl barley or farro and reduce heat so mixture is at a simmer. Cover pot and cook soup until barley is tender, 25–30 minutes.
0. Uncover pot and add 6 oz. green beans, trimmed, cut into 2" pieces, and 1 medium zucchini, quartered lengthwise, cut crosswise into ½" pieces; cook until beans are tender, 10–12 minutes.
0. Scrape roasted tomatoes and corn, along with any juices on baking sheet into pot, and add 1 bunch mature spinach, stems removed, leaves thinly sliced (about 2 cups); cook until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Fish out bay leaf and thyme sprigs; discard. Taste soup and season with more salt if needed.
0. Make the pistou. While the soup is cooking, blend 1 cup (packed) finely chopped basil, 2 Tbsp. finely chopped chives, 2 Tbsp. finely chopped mint, 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 2 Tbsp. finely grated Pecorino Romano, and 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest in a measuring glass or other tall, narrow container with an immersion blender until the consistency of pesto. Stir in up to another 1 Tbsp. oil if needed to loosen more. (Alternatively you can finely chop herbs with a chef’s knife and mix with remaining ingredients in a small bowl to combine.)
0. Ladle soup into bowls and spoon some pistou into each. Serve with more Pecorino Romano alongside for sprinkling over.
