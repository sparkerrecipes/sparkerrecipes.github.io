### Ingredients
* 6 bone-in chicken thighs
* ⅓ cup and 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
* 1 (13½ oz.) can of coconut milk
* 3⁄4 cup cider vinegar
* 8 garlic cloves, peeled
* 4 bay leaves
* 2 teaspoons black pepper
* 1-2 lbs green beans
* 1 scallion, thinly sliced (for topping)

### Chicken Directions
1. In a mixing bowl, pour ⅓c soy sauce over the chicken and let sit for 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally.
0. Transfer the chicken to a medium-high skillet, skin-side down. Make sure that extra marinade goes back in the mixing bowl. You don't need to grease the pan prior to this. Cook for about 4 minutes on each side until browned.
0. Whisk the coconut milk, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, black pepper, and 2 tbsp soy sauce into the bowl.
  0. _(this is a good time to preheat the oven, see below)_
0. Drain the fat from the skillet, then add the mixture. Let the chicken simmer, skin-side down, for 20 minutes.
  0. _(this is a good time to start some rice)_
0. Flip the chicken, skin-side up, and simmer for another 15 minutes.
0. Take the chicken out to a plate, covered in foil. Remove the bay leaves and reduce the sauce over medium-high another 8-10 minutes.
0. Serve the chicken and beans atop rice, covered in sauce and then sprinkled with green onion

### Veggie Directions
0. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
0. When the oven is hot, arrange the green beans in a single layer on a roasting pan over aluminum foil. Don't worry too much if some overlap. Drizzle olive oil to coat, then sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until a few brown spots appear.
