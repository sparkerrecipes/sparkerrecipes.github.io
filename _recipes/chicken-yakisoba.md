### Directions
0. Stir ¼ cup oyster sauce, ¼ cup soy sauce, 2 Tbsp. mirin, and 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. ketchup in a small bowl to combine.
0. Toss 1 lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs (4–6), cut into 2" pieces, with **only 2 Tbsp**  sauce mixture in a medium bowl to coat.
0. Heat 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high. Arrange chicken in wok in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over with a spatula and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon.
0. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil in wok over medium-high. Cook 1 small onion, thinly sliced, tossing often, until softened and starting to brown, about 1 minute.
0. Add 1 medium red bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed,cut into 2" pieces, 6 oz. shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps thinly sliced, 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped, and one 1" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant and bell pepper and mushrooms are starting to soften, about 3 minutes.
0. Add ¼ small head of green cabbage (about 6 oz.), cut into 2" pieces; stir to combine. Return chicken to wok; toss to combine. Cover with a lid and cook until cabbage is tender, 5–7 minutes. If cabbage releases too much liquid, uncover and cook until liquid has *almost* completely evaporated.
0. Add 16 oz. fresh (or frozen, thawed) yakisoba noodles, and gently toss to separate. Add a little water if needed to cook the noodles.
0. Add remaining oyster sauce mixture and toss to coat. Remove wok from heat and top noodles with thinly sliced scallion greens.
