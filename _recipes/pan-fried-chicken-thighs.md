title: Pan-Fried Chicken Thighs
tags: main
---

### Ingredients
* As many bone-in skin-on chicken thighs as will fit in your skillet. For me, this is about six.
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* 1 or 2 other seasonings if you like. I have been using onion powder and oregano lately.

### Directions
1. Heat a layer of olive oil in the skillet on medium. Season both sides of the chicken thighs
2. Place the chicken breasts skin-side down for about 20 minutes. Lift up one of the thighs and take a peek at the skin - if it's golden brown, it's done.
3. Flip it over and cook for another 20 minutes or so.

Serve with green beans, edamame, or a [tomato and avocado salad](http://www.marthastewart.com/333809/tomato-and-avocado-salad)
