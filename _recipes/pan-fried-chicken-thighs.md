title: Pan-Fried Chicken Thighs

_I come from the land of fried chicken, and I will tell you my only two secrets. First, don't mess with the natural flavors of fresh chicken very much. Leave breading and other fanciful frying techniques for pork, frozen chicken, or if you want to serve gravy as well. Second, thighs are so much more flavorful and cheaper than chicken breasts. Breasts are for amateurs._

### Ingredients
* As many bone-in skin-on chicken thighs as will fit in your skillet. For me, this is about six.
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* 1 or 2 other seasonings if you like. I have been using onion powder and oregano lately.

### Directions
1. Heat a layer of olive oil in the skillet on medium. Season both sides of the chicken thighs
2. Place the chicken breasts skin-side down for about 20 minutes. Lift up one of the thighs and take a peek at the skin - if it's golden brown, it's done.
3. Flip it over and cook for another 20 minutes or so.

Serve with green beans, edamame, or a [tomato and avocado salad](http://www.marthastewart.com/333809/tomato-and-avocado-salad)
