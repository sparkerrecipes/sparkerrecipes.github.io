[Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/a14362/cranberry-swirl-cheesecake-bars-rbk0912/) but really, my niece.
### Ingredients
* 1/2 c. cranberries (thawed if frozen)
* 1/2 c. frozen raspberries, thawed
* 1 tsp. grated orange zest plus 1/4 cup orange juice
* 1 c. sugar, divided
* 4 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus more for pan
* 1 9-oz pkg. chocolate wafer cookies (such as Nabisco Famous Wafers)
* 3 8-oz pkgs. cream cheese, at room temp
* 3/4 c. sour cream
* 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp. pure vanilla extract
* 3 large eggs

### Instructions
0. In a medium saucepan, combine cranberries, raspberries, orange zest and juice and 1/4 cup sugar. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until cranberries burst and sauce thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer mixture to food processor and puree until smooth. Strain into medium bowl, let cool 10 minutes, then refrigerate until ready to use.
0. Heat oven to 375°F. Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with some butter. In clean food processor, pulse chocolate wafers into fine crumbs. Add melted butter and pulse to incorporate. Press crumb mixture into bottom and 2½ inches up sides of pan. Bake until crust is set and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F.
0. While crust is cooling, in large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together cream cheese, sour cream, flour, vanilla and remaining 3/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Transfer ½ cup filling to a bowl; set aside. Pour remaining filling into cooled crust.
0. Whisk reserved filling into cranberry mixture (it will be thin) and transfer to resealable plastic bag. Snip tiny corner off bag and pipe lines lengthwise over batter. Drag skewer across lines to form pattern. Bake until cheesecake is just set (center should still wobble slightly), 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely, then refrigerate at least 3 hours before cutting into bars.
