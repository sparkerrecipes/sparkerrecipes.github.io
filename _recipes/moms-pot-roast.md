_There are probably better pot roast recipes out there, but I haven't found one that maximizes the "flavor to work" ratio like this. It makes a whole lot of tasty food with almost no effort. That's probably why it became a tradition in our household growing up._

### Ingredients
* 1 chuck roast – allow about .5 - .75 lbs per person.
* Lawry’s seasoning salt
* Yellow onions, baby carrots, and yukon/golden/fingerling potatoes as desired.

### Steps
__Make sure roast is frozen before cooking. Seriously.__

1. Put frozen roast in roasting pan with cover.
2. Sprinkle about 1-2 teaspoons of Lawry’s seasoning on top of frozen roast.
3. Take one of the onions, cut in half, and lay each half cut-side-down on top of the roast.
4. Arrange other vegetables to side of roast in pan.
5. Cover pot and bake at 225 for ten (10) hours.
