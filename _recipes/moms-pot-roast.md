_One of my favorite dishes and a sparker family tradition. Great for feeding large crowds as you can make well in advance and entertain while it's finishing. As the frozen roast thaws, it keeps the meat juicy and tender. Extra veggies in the pot soak up the wonderful juices and provide a one-pot meal._

_The leftovers are great for a stew or for sandwiches with Swiss cheese._

### Ingredients
* 1 chuck roast – allow about .5 - .75 lbs per person.
* Lawry’s seasoning salt (red & white jar)
* Spanish/Vidalia Onions, baby carrots, and yukon/golden/fingerling potatoes as desired.

### Steps
__Make sure roast is frozen before cooking. Seriously.__

1. Put frozen roast in roasting pan with cover.
2. Sprinkle about 1-2 teaspoons of Lawry’s seasoning on top of frozen roast.
3. Take one of the onions, cut in half, and lay each half cut-side-down on top of the roast.
4. Arrange other vegetables to side of roast in pan.
5. Cover pot and bake at 225 for ten (10) hours.
