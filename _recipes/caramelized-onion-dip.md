This makes enough to feed a party. Cut in thirds for a smaller event.

### Ingredients
* 3 medium size yellow onions
* 2 tablespoons salted butter
* 2 teaspoons each salt and sugar
* 1/4 cup dry white wine
* 12 ounces sour cream
* 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1 clove fresh garlic, grated (optional)
* fresh flat-leaf parsley, minced, to taste
* a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce (!!) to taste

### Directions
0. Peel the onions and slice them very thinly with a mandoline.
0. Heat the butter in a nonstick skillet or dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, sprinkle with salt and sugar, and saute for 10-15 minutes, stirring every few minutes. Pour a little bit of wine in and let it sizzle out. Stir, add wine, sizzle, etc. After about 30 minutes, your onions should be deeply golden brown and fragrant.
0. Transfer onions to a cutting board and chop coarsely into small pieces
0. In a separate bowl, mix the cream cheese and sour cream with a hand mixer or a spoon (depending on how soft the cream cheese is). Stir in the onions and a handful of fresh parsley. Add a small splash (tsp or so) of soy sauce or Worcestershire
