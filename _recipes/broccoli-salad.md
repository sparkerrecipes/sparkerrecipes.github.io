### Ingredients
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 5 to 6 cups fresh broccoli florets (about 1 pound of florets)
* 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
* 1/2 cup cooked, crumbled bacon (optional)
* 1/4 cup red onion, chopped
* 1 cup frozen peas, thawed (or fresh peas if you can get them)

#### Dressing ingredients
* 1 cup mayonnaise
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 1/4 cup honey

### Directions
0. Blanch the broccoli: Bring a large pot of water, salted with a teaspoon of salt, to a boil. Add the broccoli florets. Cook 1-2 minutes, depending on how crunchy you want the broccoli. Do not cook for more than 2 minutes, or the broccoli will get mushy.
0. Drain the broccoli and immediately put into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. After the broccoli cools, drain it well (pat dry on a clean tea towel or put in a salad spinner to remove excess moisture).
0. Combine dressing ingredients, then toss the salad with the dressing.
0. Add broccoli florets, almonds, crumbled bacon, chopped onion, and peas.
0. Chill at least one hour.
