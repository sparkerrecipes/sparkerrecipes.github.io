### Ingredients
* 8 cups broccoli florets
* ½ cup red onion diced
* ½ cup dried cranberries
* ½ cup toasted slivered almonds

#### Dressing ingredients

### Directions
0. Blanch the broccoli: Bring a large pot of water, salted with a teaspoon of salt, to a boil. Add the broccoli florets. Cook 1-2 minutes, depending on how crunchy you want the broccoli. Do not cook for more than 2 minutes, or the broccoli will get mushy.
0. Drain the broccoli and immediately put into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. After the broccoli cools, drain it well (pat dry on a clean tea towel or put in a salad spinner to remove excess moisture).
0. Combine dressing ingredients, then toss the salad with the dressing.
