### Ingredients
* 1.5c and 1c flour
* 1 tsp table salt
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices
* 1/2 cup cold vegetable shortening, cut into 4 pieces
* 1/4 cup cold vodka
* 1/3 cup cold water

### Instructions
0. Blend 1.5c flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor until combined, about two seconds.
0. Add butter & shortening, process until it's clumpy (about 10-15 sec). Add remaining cup of flour and pulse 5 more times.
0. Empty mixture into another bowl. Fold vodka & water into bowl, pressing down. It should stick together and be just a little sticky - if not, add cold water by the tbsp until it is.
