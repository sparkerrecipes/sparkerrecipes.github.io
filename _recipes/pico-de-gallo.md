### Ingredients
* 1 red onion
* 4-5 roma tomatoes
* 1-2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 jalapeno, seeds and most membranes removed
* Juice of 1 lime
* salt

### Directions
Dice and combine ingredients. I usually aim to have just a little more tomato than onion, so eyeball appropriately. It also doesn't come out too spicy - leave more membrane or add another pepper if you want it hotter.
