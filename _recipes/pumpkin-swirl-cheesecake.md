### Ingredients - Crust
* 2 ½ cups (170-175 g) graham cracker crumbs, about 16-17 rectangle crackers
* 5 tablespoons (37 g) brown sugar
* 10 tablespoons (85 g) butter, melted

### Ingredients - Cheesecake
* 3 (8-ounce) packages (680 g) full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* 1 cup (212 g) granulated sugar
* ⅔ cup (160 g) full-fat sour cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 large (150 g) eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten
* 1 ¼ cups (285 g) canned pumpkin puree
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
* ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon ground allspice

### Ingredients - White Chocolate Mousse
* 4 ounces (113 g) Ghirardelli white chocolate bars - do NOT substitute!
* 4 ounces (113 g) cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* ⅔ cup (242 g) heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons (15 g) powdered sugar
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Instructions
0. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven with another oven rack several inches below. Place a 9x13-inch pan on the bottom rack and fill with several inches of water. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
0. Wrap the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with foil (to prevent butter leaking out while baking). The foil should stick out from underneath the pan's bottom edges. Fold them *upwards* to keep moisture in.
0. For the crust, in a medium bowl, add the graham cracker crumbs and brown sugar. Toss to combine. Stir in the melted butter until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Press this mixture into the bottom and 1-inch up the sides of the prepared pan.
0. For the cheesecake batter, with a handheld electric mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the softened cream cheese and sugar. Mix until well-combined and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sour cream and vanilla and mix until well-combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
0. Add the lightly beaten eggs and mix until just combined. Don't over mix at this step or too much air can be incorporated into the batter causing it to crack while baking (a few cracks are ok since it's covered in a topping, but it still helps to minimize the cracks, if possible).
0. Measure out 2 cups of the cheesecake batter (about 285 g) into a medium bowl. Add the pumpkin puree, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice, and mix together until evenly combined (again, try not to over mix).
0. Spread half of the plain cheesecake batter evenly over the graham cracker crust.
0. Spoon about 2 cups of the pumpkin batter over the cheesecake layer (reserve at least 1 cup of the pumpkin batter for later) and spread evenly.
0. Spread the remaining plain cheesecake batter over the top of the pumpkin cheesecake layer.
0. Dollop the remaining pumpkin cheesecake batter across the top. You should have something that looks 50/50 pumpkin and cheesecake.
0. Use a knife to swirl the layers together – making sure the knife gets all the way to the crust (without gouging the crust).
0. Bake the cheesecake on the middle rack (with the pan of hot water below) for 60-70 minutes until the edges are set and the middle 2-inches of the cheesecake is still slightly jiggly. Add time as needed.
0. Remove the cheesecake from the oven. Let cool for 10 minutes, then use a butter knife to separate the edges of the cheesecake from the springform pan but do not remove it. Let cool completely.
0. For the white chocolate mousse topping, in a medium bowl, melt the white chocolate according to the package directions.
0. Combine the softened cream cheese and chocolate in the bowl of a stand mixer and use the paddle attachment to mix. Periodically use a spatula to scrape down the sides **and** up from the bottom where chocolate will collect.
0. Let the mixture cool until room temperature. If the mixture or the bowl is warm, the cream may not thicken in the next step.
0. Add the heavy cream (see note), powdered sugar, vanilla and cinnamon, and mix on low speed to combine. Increase speed to medium and continue mixing until the mixture is thick with semifirm peaks.
0. Spread the topping evenly over the cheesecake. Loosely cover the cheesecake and refrigerate until fully chilled, 6 to 8 hours.
0. Serve within 24 hours, or cover the cheesecake tightly with a layer of plastic wrap followed by a layer of foil and freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator for 24-36 hours before serving.

### Notes
If the heavy cream you are using is less than 40% milkfat, it’s best to whip the cream with the powdered sugar, vanilla and cinnamon in a separate bowl to sturdy, soft peaks and fold it into the white chocolate mixture (the Darigold heavy cream from Costco will work fine being mixed directly into the white chocolate mixture).
