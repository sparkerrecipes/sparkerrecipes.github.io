### Ingredients
¾ cup whole farro
2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 lb.), scrubbed, cut into ½" pieces
4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
3 bacon slices, coarsely chopped
1 medium sweet onion, coarsely chopped
1 Tbsp. thyme leaves
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 cup brussels sprouts, leaves removed, cores thinly sliced
1 Tbsp. toasted benne or sesame seeds, plus more for sprinkling
4 over-easy or fried eggs

### Directions
1. Cook farro in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until al dente, 30–40 minutes. Drain farro well and let cool slightly.
0. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°. Toss sweet potatoes on a large rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp. oil to coat; season with salt. Roast, tossing halfway through, until lightly browned and tender, 12–15 minutes.
0. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium. Add bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and mostly crisp, 7–9 minutes. Add onion and thyme and cook, tossing occasionally, until onion is softened, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and brussels sprouts and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic is softened and brussels sprouts are bright green and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add farro, sweet potatoes, and 1 Tbsp. benne seeds. Cook hash, tossing occasionally, until farro is warmed through, about 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
0. To serve, divide hash among plates and top with eggs. Spoon chermoula over and sprinkle with benne seeds.
