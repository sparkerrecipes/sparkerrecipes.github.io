### Ingredients - Sauce
* ¼ cup cornstarch
* ¼ cup water
* 3½ cups chicken broth
* ¼ cup soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp oyster sauce
* ½ tsp salt
* ½ tsp sugar
* ¼ tsp ground white pepper
* 1 pinch ground ginger
* ⅛ tsp sesame oil

### Ingredients - Flour Mixture

* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 Tbsp Lawry's Seasoned Salt
* 1 tsp ground white pepper
* 2 Tbsp garlic powder
* ½ tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional)

### Ingredients - Milk Batter
* 3 eggs
* 3 cups milk (I used almond milk - it was fine)
* 1 Tbsp Lawry's Seasoned Salt
* ½ tsp ground white pepper

### Ingredients - Everything Else
* 2 lbs chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
* ½ cup roasted cashews, for garnish
* ½ cup chopped green onion, for garnish

### Directions
1. Heat fryer to 350°F or heat a layer of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high.
1. In a bowl, combine flour, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon white pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.
1. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, milk and remaining salt and white pepper.
1. With each piece of chicken, completely coat with flour mixture, dunk in egg-milk mixture and then coat again with flour mixture.
1. Transfer coated chicken pieces to fryer and fry, 2 to 3 minutes each. Remove from fryer and set on a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack.
1. In a small bowl, add cornstarch and then water; whisk together until completely combined to make a slurry.
1. In a saucepan over high heat, add remaining sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add slurry and stir until sauce develops a gravy-like consistency. Reduce heat to minimum
1. When ready to serve, refry chicken, 2 to 3 minutes; remove chicken from fryer and plate it with sauce. Garnish with cashews and green onion and serve hot over rice.
