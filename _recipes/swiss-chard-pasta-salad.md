### Ingredients
* 10 oz. ditalini or other small pasta
* 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ Morton kosher salt, plus more
* 2 bunches Swiss chard
* ⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* ½ cup coarsely chopped raw pistachios
* 2 Tbsp. thinly sliced sage
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* ⅓cup sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
* 2 Tbsp. coarsely chopped capers
* ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
* 5 oz. feta, crumbled

### Directions
0. Cook 10 oz. ditalini or other small pasta in a medium pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente, then drain.
0. Meanwhile, remove ribs and stems from 2 bunches Swiss chard; slice very thinly. Coarsely chop leaves; set aside. Heat ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook chard ribs and stems, stirring occasionally, until lightly crisped, about 4 minutes.

0. Pour chard mixture into a large bowl and stir in 2 garlic cloves, finely grated, ⅓ cup sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar, 2 Tbsp. coarsely chopped capers, ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt; season with freshly ground black pepper. Add pasta and toss to combine, then mix in 5 oz. feta, crumbled.
