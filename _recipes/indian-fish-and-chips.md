### Ingredients

#### For Potatoes
* 4 sweet potatoes
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper

#### For Fish
* 1 lime
* 4 tbsp chopped cilantro
* 1c chickpea flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 1/2 tbsp garam masala
* 4oz sour cream
* 4 tilapia fillets

### Directions

* Preheat oven to 450. Cut sweet potato into flat wedges about 1/2in thick. Toss weeds with ground ginger, oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange in a single layer on parchment paper and roast until brown & tender, 20-25 minutes.

* In a large bowl, make the batter. Whisk the chickpea flour, baking powder, garam masala, and 1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper. Then add 1/2c cold water. Chill in refrigerator for at least 5 minutes.

* In a smaller bowl, make the dipping sauce for the fish. Whisk the sour cream, half of the cilantro, juice and zest from 1 lime, and 1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper.

* Pat the tilapia dry, cut into 1 inch-wide strips. Season with salt & pepper.

* Heat a thin layer of vegetable oil in a frying pan. When shimmering, dip the tilapia strips in batter, dripping off any excess. Fry the strips in batches, looking for puffed crusts about 3-5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towel and sprinkle lightly with salt.

* If you want to get fancy, you can service this with additional lime wedges to sprinkle over the fish.
