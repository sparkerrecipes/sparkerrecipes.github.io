### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 onion, diced
* 4–6 garlic cloves, rough chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes
* 1/4 cup golden raisins or apricots or really anything
* 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts, or slivered almonds
* 1/4 - 1/2 cup white wine
* 5–6 cups packed spinach, chopped - or chard, beet tops, kale, or just about anything
* salt and pepper to taste
* pinch of sugar, nutmeg

### Directions
0. Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high. Add onion and cook until tender, about 3-4 minutes.
0. Lower heat to medium, add garlic and chili flakes, and saute a few more minutes, until fragrant.
0. Add raisins and wine, sauteeing until the wine mostly–but not totally–cooks off. Add more at any time if you think it needs it
0. Add greens, stirring to wilt. Spinach will cook in a couple minutes, while sturdier greens will take longer.
0. Season with a little salt and pepper. Continue sauteeing until desired tenderness, then remove from heat.
0. Add a pinch of sugar and nutmeg. Stir in pine nuts.
