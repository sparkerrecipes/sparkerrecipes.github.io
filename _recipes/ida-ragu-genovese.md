### Ingredients
* 1.5lbs beef, ideally silverside or bavette
* 2 carrots
* 2 sticks celery
* 2lbs yellow onions
* 1c (really? doublecheck this as you make this) extra virgin olive oil
* 4 bay leaves
* About half a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp	salt
* About 30g grated parmesan per person to serve

### Instructions
0. Peel the carrots and finely chop them and the celery into a half-centimetre dice.
0. Peel and slice the onions into half rings, the thinner the better. Use a mandolin if you have one.
0. Add the olive oil to a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, followed by the carrots, celery, onions and bay leaves.
0. Prepare the meat by removing any excess fat and cutting it into three-centimetre cubes.
0. Heat the pan of vegetables on a low flame for five minutes, stirring occasionally.
0. Add the meat, ground black pepper and salt. Stir.
0. Cover and cook on the same low heat for around three to four hours. There is no need to add water or break up the cubed beef as the onions will release enough liquid into the cooking sauce to prevent it from drying out. However, it is important to check and occasionally stir it. The meat should never be allowed to stick to the bottom of the pan. The ragù is ready when the meat is fork-tender and easily shredded or broken up with a whisk.
0. Remove the bay leaves and, in another pan, cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water. (Dried pasta corta such as rigatoni, paccheri or mezze 0. maniche are ideal with this ragù.)
0. Drain the pasta when al dente and return to the empty pan, reserving two cups of the cooking water.
0. Transfer one ladle per person of the ragù into the pasta, loosening it up with a little of the reserved pasta water if needed.
0. Add the parmesan and a couple more twists of ground pepper. Mix it through well, then serve immediately.
