### Ingredients - Wings
* 2½ lb. chicken wings, drumettes and flats separated, patted dry with paper towels
* ¼ cup lemon pepper seasoning (such as Simply Organic)
* 1 Tbsp. English mustard powder (such as Colman’s)
* 1 tsp. sugar
* ¼ cup cornstarch
* 1 Tbsp. baking powder
* 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil

### Ingredients - Sauce
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 1 Tbsp. freshly ground pepper
* ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
* 2 Tbsp. hot sauce, preferably cayenne-based (such as Frank’s or Crystal)
* 2½ tsp. garlic powder
* 2 tsp. sugar
* ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt
* 2 Tbsp. finely grated lemon zest

### Directions
0. Toss 2½ lb. chicken wings (pat dry - it's important!), drumettes and flats separated, with ¼ cup lemon pepper seasoning, 1 Tbsp. English mustard powder, and 1 tsp. sugar in a large bowl until wings are thoroughly and evenly coated.
0. Add ¼ cup cornstarch and 1 Tbsp. baking powder and toss again until evenly coated. Arrange wings in a single layer on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet, shaking off any excess starch into bowl as you go. Chill, uncovered, at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.
0. Preheat oven to 425°.
0. Drizzle 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil evenly over wings (no need to oil the other side). Bake, rotating baking sheet front to back and turning wings over halfway through, until deep golden brown and crisp, 50–60 minutes.
0. About 15 minute before wings are done, melt ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp. freshly ground pepper and cook just until fragrant, 1–2 minutes.
0. Add ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. hot sauce, preferably cayenne-based, 2½ tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. sugar, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and cook, whisking vigorously, just until emulsified and smooth, about 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat and let sauce cool until thickened slightly, 5–10 minutes.
0. Transfer wings to a large bowl, drizzle sauce over, and toss until wings are coated. Arrange on a platter or plates to serve.
