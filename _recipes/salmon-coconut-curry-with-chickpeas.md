### Ingredients
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 4 6-ounce skin-on salmon filets
* 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
* 1 small onion, diced (about 1 small)
* 3 peeled garlic cloves, grated
* 1 2-inch piece peeled ginger, grated
* 1 large Fresno chili, finely diced
* 1 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
* 1 1/2 teaspoons Madras curry powder

* 5 ounces baby spinach

### Directions
* Season both sides of salmon with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Set aside on a plate.
* Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with oil to fully coat the bottom of the pan.
* Add salmon to the pan, skin-side down, and cook without disturbing until skin is crispy, 5 to 6 minutes.
* Return to the plate (skin-side up) and set aside.
* Add remaining teaspoon of oil, then add onions, garlic, ginger, and Fresno chili pepper; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
* Add chickpeas and curry powder and continue to cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more.
* Reduce heat to medium-low, add coconut milk, stirring, to release any browned bits stuck to the pan.
* Stir in spinach and 1/2 teaspoon salt . Cover the pan and cook 2 minutes until spinach wilts.
* Add the salmon, skin-side-up, and cook until fish is done, about 5 to 6 minutes.
