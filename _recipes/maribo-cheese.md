_Will I ever try this? Unlikely, but I have night terrors at the idea of never eating this cheese again._

### Ingredients
* 20 litres of whole milk
* 8 pinches starter culture or 1 dl buttermilk or soured milk 
* 8 ml rennet
* 475 g salt
* Cheese coating

### Required tools
* Pot with lid
* Collander
* Sieve spoon
* Long knife
* Dropper
* Thermometer
* Timer
* Plastic gloves
* Cheese trays 
* Cheese mats
* Large cheese mould with lid

### Steps
0. Pour milk into the pot and slowly heat it to 32°C
0. In a small amount cold water, mix starter culture. Add the mix to the milk and gently stir for half a minute.
0. Put a lid on the pot and wrap it in a towel to keep it warm. Let it rest for 30 minutes.
0. Mix rennet with a small amount of cold water – add it to the milk and stir thoroughly for half a minute.
0. Cover the pot with a lid and a towel once again and leave it for 35 minutes.
0. Prepare a brine: Boil 3 litres of water. Add 450 g of salt and stir until the salt is dissolved. Leave the brine to cool (20°C) until tomorrow.
0. The milk has now coagulated and the curd has developed. 
0. Cut the curd into ½-1 cm cubes using a long knife.
0. Cover the pot with lid and the towel once again - leave it for 5 minutes.
0. With a sieve spoon, stir the curd gently for 15 minutes.
0. Remove 7-8 litres of whey.
0. Add 4 litres of warm water (55°C) while gently stirring. Add the water in small portions over 30 minutes to slowly raise the temperature of the curd to 37°C.
0. Continue stirring for 10 minutes.
0. Drain off all whey.
0. Add 25 g of salt to the curd and knead the curd with the salt for 5 minutes.
0. Use plastic gloves for optimal hygiene.
0. Place a large mould in a pot, eventually on top of two cheese mats. Line the mould with a scolded cheese cloth. Now, fill the mould with the curd. Fold the excess cheese cloth over the top of the curd. Make sure there are a minimum of folds and creases across the top before you put the mould lid on - this could cause an uneveness to the cheese crust.
0. Apply pressure to the cheese - use a cheese press or use the following instructions:
0. Add a solid bowl - or similar - on top of the mould lid. It must reach at least 3 cm above the brim of the mould. Now, get a bucket or pot with a smaller diameter than the cheese pot and place it on top of the solid bowl. Fill the inserted bucket/pot with water to create pressure on the cheese.
0. Leave the cheese under pressure for ½ hour.
0. You may leave the cheese under pressure for another ½ hour or better do the following: Release the pressure and take out the cheese, flip it over and put it back into the mould and apply pressure again - this time you double the pressure, if possible. Leave the cheese under pressure for another ½ hour.
0. Release the pressure from the cheese and take out the cheese.
0. Soak the cheese in the brine you made earlier - for 4 hours. 
0. Place the cheese in a cheese tray with cheese mat and leave it at 20°C for 1 day. Flip over the cheese regularly to dry the crust.
0. Apply cheese coating.
0. Eventually apply a second layer of cheese coating after 1 week.
0. Mature the cheese for 3-4 weeks at 16°C - then 1-2 weeks at 12°C. If you can not provide these temperatures, mature it in the fridge but be aware it prolongs the maturation time.
0. Should mouldy patches appear on the crust during maturation, carefully scrabe and wash them off, and finish of by saltning it and adding a new layer of coating.
