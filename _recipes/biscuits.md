Recently I've been trying the technique of [this recipe](http://chefmichaelsmith.com/recipe/frozen-butter-biscuits/) with the ingredients of [this one](https://www.sugardishme.com/the-biggest-fattest-fluffiest-all-butter-biscuits/).

### Ingredients
* 2c flour
* 1.5 tbsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1.5 tsp kosher salt
* 8 tbsp butter, cut into small pats
* 1c of buttermilk (optional: 1/2c buttermilk, 1/2/c sour cream instead)

### Directions
1. Preheat over to 435
2. Combine dry ingredients in a food processor - flour, powder, soda, salt
3. Add butter and pulse until crumbly
4. Remove from food processor and fold in milk (and cream, if using). Dough should be just short of wet
5. Transfer to a well floured, wooden work surface. Knead a bit further.
6. Again with lots of flour, roll it out into a roughly 10 in square.
7. Fold that into thirds over the center one direction into one long strip of folded-over dough.
8. Fold the strip over itself into thirds in the center, creating a very folder and thick square about 1/3 the size of the original.
9. Roll the square out and repeat the folding process of 7 & 8 twice.
10. Roll the square out a third time but don't fold it again. It should be pretty thick at this point. If not, fold it again.
10. At the end of the third rolling, cut rounds (I use a water glass) and transfer them to a baking sheet with parchment paper. Take the scraps, knead them into a ball, and cut those. You should get 10-12 biscuits out of this.
11. Spray lightly with spray butter or olive oil, then bake for about 15 minutes until golden.
