  Blackening Spice:
    - 3 tablespoons smoked paprika
    - 1 tablespoon onion powder
    - 1 teaspoon dried ground thyme
    - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
    - 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
    - 1 teaspoon salt
    - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

  The Rest:
    - 4 tilapia fillets
    - 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil
    - 1/2 lemon, juiced
instructions:
  - In a small bowl combine all of the spices. Press a heaping tablespoon of the spice mix onto each fillet so that both sides are liberally coated. Allow the fish to sit for 15 minutes at room temperature prior to cooking.
  - In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is almost smoking, add the fillets and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Sprinkle with lemon juice and transfer the fillets to serving platter.
