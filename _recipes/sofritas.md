### Ingredients
* 1 yellow onion, stem removed, peeled, and quartered
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1 poblano pepper
* 1 jalapeño pepper
* 2 Roma plum tomatoes, ripe
* 3 cloves garlic, the base 1/16-inch sliced off
* 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil, divided
* 1 14 oz block super firm tofu
* 2 canned chipotle peppers, if one of the peppers have a stem, slice it off before using
* 1 tbsp adobo sauce, the sauce from the can of chipotle peppers
* 2 tbsp tamari, or regular soy sauce
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
* 1 ½ tsp dried oregano, preferably Mexican oregano
* 1 ½ tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* Fresh cilantro, for garnish

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place the onion, bell pepper, poblano pepper, jalapeño pepper, and tomatoes in a baking dish. Place the trimmed garlic cloves on a small square of aluminum foil and drizzle them with a quarter teaspoon of oil. Tightly wrap the garlic cloves in the foil and place them in the baking dish with the other veggies.
1. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of oil over the vegetables, then roast them for 25-30 minutes, until the peppers are very soft and charred on top and the tomatoes and onions are soft.
1. While the vegetables roast, shred the entire block of tofu on the largest holes of a box grater over a mixing bowl. Drizzle the tofu with the remaining oil (about 1 scant tablespoon) and toss well to coat.
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the tofu out evenly on the baking sheet and roast, alongside the vegetables, for 25 minutes. Stir well, then bake another 5-10 minutes or until the top of the tofu is crispy and golden brown.
1. Once done roasting, remove the vegetables from the oven and let them cool at room temperature for at least 5 minutes or until cool enough to handle safely.
1. Carefully tear the stems from the peppers and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Transfer the seeded peppers to a food processor with the roasted tomatoes and onions. Remove the garlic cloves from the aluminum foil and gently open them to reveal the roasted garlic inside. Squeeze the garlic into the food processor.
1. Add the chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tamari, tomato paste, red wine vinegar, oregano, chili powder, cumin, and salt to the food processor. Lock on the food processor lid and pulse until the mixture is well-blended. I like to maintain some chunkiness, though it’s just as delicious when blended smooth.
1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour the sauce into the skillet and add the crispy tofu. Stir well, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer the tofu in the sauce for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Season the sofritas to taste with more salt if necessary. Serve it hot, garnished with fresh chopped cilantro, over rice, in a taco or burrito, or with Black Bean and Corn Salad. Top with guacamole.
