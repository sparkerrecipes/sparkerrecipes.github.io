title: Mom's BBQ Chiken
---

_Proper BBQ chicken is a little tedious to make on the grill. My mother is nothing if not pragmatic, and makes a much less labor-intensive version. It's a Parker family Christmas tradition_

### Ingredients
* Chicken
* BBQ Sauce

### Directions
1. Coat baking pan with nonstick spray or vegetable oil. Bake chicken at 350 for 45 minutes.
2. Coat chicken pieces with sauce and grill on low to medium heat (~250 degrees) for about 8 minutes per side. The chicken will be safe to eat at this point, so you're really just building up a nice char from the sauce.
