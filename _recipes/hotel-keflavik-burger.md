_I was recently and unexpectedly in Iceland. I was treated to the best cheeseburger of my life. If you find yourself in Keflavik, stop by Hotel Keflavik and try it._

_This is the closest I can come to that with easily-sourced ingredients._

### Source
[Hotel Keflavik](https://kef.is/kefrestaurant/)

### Ingredients
* Arugulua
* Tomato
* Thinly-sliced cucumber
* Thinly-sliced fresh red onion
* Dijon mustard
* Havarti cheese (a substitute for Maribo, the bold can [see this recipe](/recipes/maribo-cheese))
* bacon
* black garlic /  mayo mixture


### Directions
1. Put all that stuff on a burger. Tomato, cucumber, mayo, and mustard goes on the bottom. Everything else on top.
