_I was recently and unexpectedly in Iceland. I was treated to a cheeseburger made with several ingredients that, so far, seem very difficult to source here in the US._

_It may haunt me for the rest of my days that it was the best burger of my life._

_If you find yourself in Keflavik, stop by Hotel Keflavik and eat a cheeseburger._

_Anyway, this is best approximation that I can think of with US ingredients._

### Source
[Hotel Keflavik](https://kef.is/kefrestaurant/)

### Ingredients
* Arugulua
* Tomato
* Thinly-sliced cucumber
* Fresh red onion
* Dijon mustard
* Havarti cheese (a poor substitute for Maribo, the bold can [see this recipe](/recipes/maribo-cheese)
* bacon
* black garlic /  mayo mixture


### Directions
1. Put all that stuff on a burger. Cucumber, mayo, mustard, and bacon goes on the bottom. Everything else on top.
