Minor tweaks from [Serious Eats Real Deal Chicken Tortilla Soup](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/real-deal-tortilla-soup-recipe.html) based on what's available at my grocery.

### Ingredients
* 2 qts chicken stock
* 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breast halves
* 2 white onions (1 split in half, 1 diced)
* 2 ears of corn, shucked and cobs reserved
* 4 cloves of garlic (2 whole, 2 diced)
* 3 tbsp ancho chile powder
* 1.5 lbs ripe tomatoes
* 1 poblano pepper, diced
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 2 tsp dried oregano
* 1 15oz can of black beans, rinsed & drained
* 3/4c fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1 tbsp corn meal

#### Garnishes
* Fresh avocado
* fried tortilla strips
* chopped scallions
* lime wedges
* sour cream

## Instructions
0. Scrape the corn off the cobs into a small bowl, reserving the cobs. Split one of the onions and peel the skin off two garlic cloves.
0. Place stock, chicken, split onion, cobs, 2 whole cloves, and the ancho chile powder in a large saucepan and cover. Boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes. When finished, discard the onion, cobs, and garlic cloves. Transfer the chicken to a plate to cool and set the chile stock aside.
0. Pre-heat broiler to high and split the tomatoes in half. On a foil lined pan, broil the tomatoes cut side-up for 15 minute minutes, about 4 inches from the heat.
0. Combine the tomatoes and enough stock to cover them in a blender. Blend until smooth, then add back to the stock.
0. Shred the chicken.
0. Heat 2 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet. Add the corn, diced onion, and diced poblano. Season with a little alt & pepper and saute until the onions just soften but nothing has browned, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook another 30 seconds.
0. Add the vegetables to the stock alone with the cumin, oregano, beans, cilantro, and more salt & pepper. Add the chicken once shredded.
0. Bring to a simmer and add the corn meal. Cook for another 10 minutes while you prepare the garnishes.
