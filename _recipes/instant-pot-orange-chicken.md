### Ingredients
* 2 lbs chicken breast or thighs cut into 1-2 inch pieces
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

#### Sauce:
* 1 cup orange juice no sugar added
* 1 tablespoon ginger grated
* 6 cloves garlic* minced
* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar or dry white wine**
* 1/2 cup tomato sauce optional
* ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ¼ cup brown sugar
* ¼ cup lite soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Sriracha***
* zest from 1 orange

#### Cornstarch Slurry
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons orange juice

#### Garnish
* 4 green onions sliced
* extra orange zest

### Directions
1. It is important for the chicken not to have any extra moisture. Dry it with a few paper towels, and then cut it into 1-2 inch chunks.
1. Heat up your pressure cooker: press Sauté, click on the Adjust button, and select More to activate the Sauté More function. This means that the food will be sautéed over medium-high heat. Wait for the Instant Pot indicator to read HOT.
1. Add the oil to the hot Instant Pot, add the chicken, and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring a few times. Cook until it just starts to get golden. When sautéing it, stir constantly so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.
1. Also, after you sauté the chicken, check if bits are stuck to the bottom. In that case, deglaze the pot with 1/4 cup orange juice and scrape the bits with a wooden spoon. If you leave the bits stuck to the bottom, they may burn or cause the pot not to come to pressure.
1. Add the sauce ingredients to the pot: remaining 3/4 cups of orange juice, minced garlic, ginger, soy sauce, white sugar, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar, orange zest, and Sriracha sauce. You can skip the Sriracha sauce or add more if you prefer your food on the spicier side.
1. Add the tomato sauce if you are using it. The tomato sauce adds tanginess to the overall sweet recipe and makes it taste more savory. It is based on your preference. I like it both ways: with and without the sauce. You can use less or completely leave it out if you want a pure orange aroma.
1. Stir gently until all the ingredients are combined and coated in sauce.
1. Close the lid, select Manual, and select 5 minutes on High Pressure. Make sure the vent is closed.
1. Use a 10-minute Natural Release. Turn off the heat. Release the remaining pressure by opening the vent. Open the lid.
1. Select the Sauté function again on LOW. In a medium bowl, combine two tablespoons of cornstarch with the orange juice, whisking until well combined and free of lumps. 
1. Add the mixture to the Instant Pot and gently stir to combine. Cook on the Sauté function for a few more minutes, stirring gently, until the sauce thickens. Simmer for 2-3 minutes.
1. If you want the sauce even thicker, mix one more tablespoon of cornstarch with orange juice and add it to the pot.
1. Let the Orange Chicken stand for 5-7 minutes; the sauce will thicken more. 
1. Serve over rice and garnish with fresh chopped green onions and extra orange zest.
