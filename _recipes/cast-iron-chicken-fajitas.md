A mishmash of [Simply Recipes](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/chicken_fajitas/) and [Paula Deen](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/gold-medal-sizzling-fajitas-recipe/index.html)

### Fajita Ingredients
* 1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast (cut or beat thin but otherwise whole)
* 2 bell peppers (whatever variety you like, cut into long strips)
* 1 sweet onion (cut into long strips)
* 10 fajita tortillas
* 3-4 tbsp vegetable oil for frying

### Marinade Ingredients
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* juice of 1 lemon or lime
* dash of hot sauce
* splash of tequila
* salt/pepper

### Toppings
* shredded lettuce
* Crema Mexican or sour cream
* pico de gallo

### Directions
1. Combine marinade ingredients in large plastic bag with chicken. Seal and put into fridge for 30-90 minutes. (While it's marinating, this is a great time to make [pico de gallo](/recipes/pico-de-gallo))
2. Heat 1-2 tbsp of vegetable oil in cast-iron skillet and sear the chicken, 3-4 minutes per side.
3. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Stack them and cover in aluminum foil.
4. Add another tbsp of vegetable oil and the vegetables. Scrape up the chicken fat and give a good stir before letting sit for 3 minutes. Stir and let sit for another 3 minutes.
5. Slice the chicken into strips. If they need a little more cooking, make room in the skillet and sear one of the newly-exposed edges for a minute or two.
