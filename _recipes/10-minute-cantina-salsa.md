_I searched long and far for the perfect salsa that is also quick to make. I've finally found it, adapted slightly from [Carlsbad Cravings](http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/fire-roasted-restaurant-blender-salsa-5-minutes/). They list it as five minutes - it's more like ten._

### Ingredients
* 2 14oz cans of fire-roasted tomatoes, drained
* 2oz diced green chiles in sauce
* 2 adobo peppers in sauce
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1 cup cilantro
* 1 small white onion in chunks
* 1 jalapeno in chunks
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp salt
* Â½ teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano (the original recipe calls for Mexican oregano, but I never have it)

### Directions
1. Put all ingredients except for the tomatoes and chilis into the blender. Pulse until roughly chopped, mixing periodically.
2. Add the tomatoes and chilis. Pulse until it reaches desired consistency. It will taste hot as hell right now, but it will mellow out.
3. Refrigerate for at least a half hour.
4. Add salt or pepper to taste (it's probably fine though)
