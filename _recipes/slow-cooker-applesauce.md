_Making pork? Make this. I suppose you can make in advance and chill like traditional applesauce, but it was mind-blowing when served hot._

### Ingredients
* 12 apples peeled, cored, and sliced thin (I used Red Delicious and it was plenty sweet)
* 3 tbsp lemon juice (approx. 1 lemon)
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/2 c water
* 1 cinnamon stick (this is plenty, don't get crazy)

### Directions
1. Combine all ingredients in a crock pot.
2. Cook on high for 5 hours. Stir a couple of times through the duration.

If you're like me, you're going to freak out around 2-3 hours in and think it isn't working because the apples on top are drying out. Everything is fine, relax. Just stir it and go on about your business.
