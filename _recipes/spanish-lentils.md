### Ingredients
* Olive oil
* 1 onion
* 1 tomato
* 1 or 2 garlic cloves
* 1 leek
* 1 bag of lentils
* Salt
* Pepper
* A bayleaf
* *Optional* Chorizo

### Directions
0. Chop the ingredients up however you'd like.  The Spaniards didn't even chop them at all.
0. Saute over low heat the onion, tomato, garlic, and leek with olive oil.  Be generous with the oil.  You're Spanish now.  
0. After about 5-6 minutes, add the lentils.  
0. Now fill the pot with water.  The measurement I usually do is about 2 fingers-width higher than the level of the lentils.  
0. Add salt and pepper and the bayleaf.  
0. Cover with high heat for about 8 minutes.  
0. Uncover it and check that everything's well dispersed, then put it on medium heat for 45 minutes.  Stir every 8-10 minutes or so and then re-cover the pot.  
0. If you're feeling good about yourself, chop and heat up some chorizo and toss it in as well.  
0. When time's up, take it off the heat and you're ready to serve!
