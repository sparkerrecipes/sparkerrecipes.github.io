tags: sauce
ingredients:
  - 28 oz can of San Marzano plum tomatoes
  - 1/8 - 1/4 lb sliced salami, the best your deli counter has available. I particularly like salami with a bit of spice to it.
  - Fresh or ground basil
  - 4 cloves garlic
  - Extra virgin olive oil
instructions:
  - Dice salami
  - In 2 tbsp olive oil, cook the garlic and salami for about 1 minute on medium-high heat.
  - Meanwhile, drain the tomatoes, keeping the sauce in a bowl.
  - Add the tomatoes to the pain and crush them with a spoon to desired thickness.
  - Cook on high for about 6-7 minutes
  - Add the reserved sauce, 1/2 c water, basil and pepper to taste
  - Heat to boil and then simmer for 10 minutes or until desired thickness."
