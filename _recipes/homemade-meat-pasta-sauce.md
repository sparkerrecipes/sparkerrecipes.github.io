_This sauce plus store-bought tortellini makes a wonderful weeknight meal. I always use a Polish salami with this for a little bit of heat. Red peppers make a good addition too._
 
### Ingredients
* 28 oz can of San Marzano plum tomatoes
* 1/8 - 1/4 lb sliced salami, the best your deli counter has available. I particularly like salami with a bit of spice to it.
* Fresh or ground basil
* 4 cloves garlic
* Extra virgin olive oil

### Steps
1. Dice salami
2. In 2 tbsp olive oil, cook the garlic and salami for about 1 minute on medium-high heat.
3. Meanwhile, drain the tomatoes, keeping the sauce in a bowl.
4. Add the tomatoes to the pain and crush them with a spoon to desired thickness.
5. Cook on high for about 6-7 minutes
6. Add the reserved sauce, 1/2 c water, basil and pepper to taste
7. Heat to boil and then simmer for 10 minutes or until desired thickness.
