### Source
Based loosely on a dish at E+O and [The Kitchy Kitchen](http://www.thekitchykitchen.com/?recipes=/crispy-brussels-sprouts-salad-with-sweet-chili-vinaigrette/).

### Ingredients
* 1.5 lbs brussel sprouts, rinsed (doesn't have to be exact)
* 1 bunch of green kale, rinsed
* 2 shallots

##### Dressing
* 3 tbsp canola oil
* 1 tbsp sweet chili sauce
* 1 tsp rice vinegar
* juice of 1/2 lime
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp sriracha

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400
1. Remove the ends of the brussel sprouts then halve them and slice them pretty thin. A bunch of leaves will fall off in this process - put them and the slices into a large bowl.
1. Remove the stems from the kale and chop them into smallish pieces. Put the kale in the same bowl as the sprouts. You want roughly equal portions of sprout and kale at this point.
0. Mix the kale and sprouts with a bit of olive oil, just enough to coat them. Spread them out on 1-2 baking sheets and roast for 15 minutes. Toss and return to oven for another 15-25 minutes until crispy.
1. Cut the shallots down to pieces about as big as the brussel sprout slices and keep separate.
0. In a small skillet, saute the shallots in a bit of canola oil until they soften and are just crisping.
0. Put the shallots and the sprout/kale mixture in the same bowl. Let it cool just a bit while you mix the dressing.
0. Dress the salad to taste and serve warm (but not hot).
