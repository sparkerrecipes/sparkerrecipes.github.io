### Source
Based loosely on a dish at E+O and [The Kitchy Kitchen](http://www.thekitchykitchen.com/?recipes=/crispy-brussels-sprouts-salad-with-sweet-chili-vinaigrette/).

### Ingredients
* 1.5 lbs brussel sprouts, rinsed (doesn't have to be exact)
* 1 bunch of green kale, rinsed
* 2 shallots

##### Dressing
* 3 tbsp canola oil
* 1 tbsp sweet chili sauce
* 1 tsp rice vinegar
* juice of 1/2 lime
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp sriracha

### Directions
1. Remove the ends of the brussel sprouts then halve them and slice them pretty thin. A bunch of leaves will fall off in this process - put them and the slices into a large bowl.
1. Remove the stems from the kale and chop them into smallish pieces. Put the kale in the same bowl as the sprouts. You want roughly equal portions of sprout and kale at this point.
1. Cut the shallots down to pieces about as big as the brussel sprout slices and keep separate.
0. In the biggest skillet you have, heat a few tbsp of canola oil and then saute the sprout/kale mixture, working in batches if you need to. Cook until browned and soft
0. In a smaller skillet, do the same for the shallots until they soften and are just crisping.
0. Put the shallots and the sprout/kale mixture in the same bowl. Let it cool just a bit while you mix the dressing.
0. Dress the salad to taste and serve warm (but not hot).
