### Ingredients
* 1 cup raw cashews
* 6 Thai chiles or 4 Fresno chiles, chopped
* 2 medium shallots, chopped
* 1 lemongrass stalk, tough outer layers removed, white and pale green parts coarsely chopped
* 5 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
* Finely grated zest from 2 limes (about 3 tsp.)
* 1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
* 3 Tbsp. canola oil
* 1 Tbsp. tomato paste
* 8 oz. cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 Tbsp. fish sauce
* 1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice
* 1 Tbsp. coarsely chopped cilantro leaves with tender stems
* For serving - cucumbers, peppers, bibb lettuce leaves, celery (also maybe mango or eggs?)

### Directions
1. Pulse cashews in a food processor until pieces are no larger than ¼". Transfers cashews to a medium bowl (it’s okay if some of the cashews have gone all the way to powder, which will thicken the dip).
2. Pulse chiles, shallots, lemongrass, garlic, lime zest, and 1 tsp. salt in food processor until very finely chopped. Scrape down sides and continue to pulse until a coarse paste forms. Transfer curry paste to a small bowl.
3. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium. Add cashews and cook, stirring often, until golden brown in most spots, 4–6 minutes. Add curry paste and cook, stirring often, until slightly darkened, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until mixture starts to stick to bottom pot, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and a splash of water and cook, scraping any browned bits that may have stuck to bottom of pot, until tomatoes are completely broken down and mixture is thickened, 7–10 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and stir in fish sauce and lime juice. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt.
5. Transfer nam prik to a medium bowl. Top with cilantro. Serve nam prik warm with serving options.
