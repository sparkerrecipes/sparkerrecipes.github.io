### Ingredients - Salad
* 1 large cauliflower (about 2 ½ pounds)
* ⅓ cup roughly chopped almonds or sliced almonds
* ⅓ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
* ⅓ cup chopped fresh basil or additional parsley
* ⅓ cup roughly chopped tender sun-dried tomatoes
* ⅓ cup chopped red onion
* ⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese or roughly chopped Kalamata olives

### Ingredients - Dressing
* ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar or 3 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 clove garlic, pressed or minced
* ½ teaspoon dried oregano
* ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
* ½ teaspoon fine salt
* Pinch of red pepper flakes

### Instructions
0. To prepare the cauliflower, use a chef’s knife to quarter it, then remove the core. Slice it as thinly as possible, then roughly chop the slices so they’re all bite-sized. Transfer the cauliflower to a medium serving bowl. 
0. To toast the almonds, warm them in a skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently and keeping a close eye on them until they’re fragrant and turning golden on the edges. Pour them into the bowl of cauliflower to cool.
0. To the bowl, add the parsley, basil, sun-dried tomatoes, onion and feta.
0. In a small bowl, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients until well blended. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss well.
0. Let the salad rest for 30 minutes before serving so the cauliflower can marinate in the dressing. Taste, and adjust if necessary—add a splash of olive oil for more richness, or a teaspoon of additional vinegar for acidity, or a pinch of salt for more overall flavor. This salad keeps very well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 5 days.
