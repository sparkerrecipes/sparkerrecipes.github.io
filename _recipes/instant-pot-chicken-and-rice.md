### Ingredients - Sauce
* 1/4 cup dry sherry
* 3/4 cup chicken broth
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika

#### Ingredients - Casserole
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced
* 3-4 carrots
* 3-4 stalks celery
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 pounds (5 to 6) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into small 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice

#### Garnish
* 1/4 cup chopped parsley

### Directions
0. In a mixing bowl or large liquid measuring cup, whisk together the sherry, chicken broth, sour cream, cream, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and paprika. If you want to cut down on dairy, replace with plant-based alternatives or just add chicken broth until you have about 2c of sauce. Set aside.
0. Select the “Sauté” setting on the pressure cooker and heat the oil in the pressure cooker.
0. Add the onion and cook for 4 minutes, until a bit softened but not browned. Add the mushrooms, celery, and carrots and cook until the mushrooms begin to wilt and give up their liquid, about 3 more minutes. Stir in the garlic and sauté for 1 more minute.
0. Stir in the chicken thighs and let them cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring often, until opaque and mostly cooked through (it’s fine if they’re still a little pink in the middle).
0. Use your spatula to pat the chicken and vegetables down into a fairly even layer. Sprinkle the rice over the top of the chicken in an even layer. Slowly pour the sauce over the rice, taking care not to disturb the layer. Use a spoon to nudge down any grains of rice that are clinging to the sides of the pot, so everything is covered with the cooking liquid.
0. Set the instant pot to Manual - 8 minutes at high pressure. The pressure cooker will take 5 to 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking time begins.
0. Let the pressure release naturally for at least 10 minutes, then quick-release the pressure. Give everything a good stir
0. Serve with parsley. Some roasted broccoli is nice on the side, too.
