* 1 clove garlic, peeled
* 2-inch piece ginger, peeled
* 2 tablespoons Tamari
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* 1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar
* 1-2 tablespoons Sambal Oelek (or Sriracha, Gochujang, other hot sauce/chili paste to taste)
* sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste

### Ingredients
* 1 lb (454 grams) firm or extra firm tofu
* sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons arrowroot starch
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
* 2 teaspoons onion powder, divided
* ¾ lb (340 grams) green beans, trimmed
* 2 green onions, sliced
* warm cooked rice, for serving
* chili crisp, for serving (optional)

### Instructions
0. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
0. In an upright blender, combine the peanut butter, water, garlic, ginger, Tamari, maple syrup, lime juice, rice vinegar, Sambal Oelek, salt, and pepper. Blend on high until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Set aside.
0. Squeeze excess moisture out of the tofu, then cut it into small cubes and place them on a clean kitchen towel. Blot the pieces dry as best you can. Transfer tofu pieces to a medium bowl.
0. To the bowl, add 2 tablespoons of the oil, salt, and pepper. Give the tofu a toss to coat. Then add the arrowroot, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon onion powder. Toss again to coat.
0. Lay the tofu out on the baking sheet in a single layer. Slide the baking sheet into the oven and set a timer for 15 minutes.
0. Wipe out the medium bowl that you used for the tofu and add the green beans to it. To the green beans, add the remaining 1 ½ tablespoons oil, remaining teaspoon garlic powder, remaining teaspoon onion powder, and some salt and pepper. Toss to coat.
0. When the timer goes off, remove the tofu from the over. Stir the tofu and move them to one half of the sheet, then add the green beans to the other. Bake for another 15-20 until the tofu is golden and the green beans are browning.
0. Briefly broil at the end for a little extra color, then serve over brown rice.
