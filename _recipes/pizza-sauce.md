_Sweet, slightly tangy, and so easy to make. Good for about 3 pizzas. You are eating 3 pizzas every 10 days or so, right?_

### Ingredients
* 1 can (28 ounces) San Marzano tomatoes
* 1 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder
* 1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

### Directions

2. Blend
3. Let sit for a bit before putting on a pizza - that seems to bring out the flavor of the red wine vinegar
